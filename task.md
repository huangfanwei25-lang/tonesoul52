- [x] Execute Phase 1-4 cleanup and validation flow from plan
**Success Criteria**: repository state is auditable by category and cleanup can proceed phase-by-phase without mixing concerns.

## Phase 103: Side-branch isolation playbook and local hygiene guard
- [x] Added `docs/plans/side_branch_isolation_playbook_2026-02-21.md`
- [x] Documented side-branch decisions for `.agent/skills/local_llm/`, `tonesoul/adaptive_gate.py`, `tests/test_adaptive_gate.py`
- [x] Added local hygiene guard flow (`.git/info/exclude` + temporary isolation before mainline healthcheck)
**Success Criteria**: side-branch work can continue without causing false-negative mainline healthcheck failures.

## Phase 104: Temporary script cleanup in mainline
- [x] Removed stale one-off root scripts (`diagnostic_post.py`, `reply_tone_tension.py`, `test_api_post.py`)
- [x] Updated script and inventory docs (`SCRIPTS_README.md`, `reports/REPO_INVENTORY.md`)

- [x] 3a Semantic Trigger
- [x] 3b Cross-session recovery
- [x] 3c Council evolution tracker
- [x] 3d Adversarial red/blue stub
**Result**: Level 3 code + tests completed in this round, then full suite revalidated (`755 passed, 3 xfailed`).

- [x] A/B/C comparison protocol
- [x] Five metrics: Task Quality / Safety Pass Rate / Consistency@Session / Disagreement Utility / Token+Latency Cost
- [x] Cost gate and promotion criteria

## Phase 82: Persona Swarm Framework
- [x] Persona swarm coordination harness + metric definitions
- [x] Persona swarm artifact and gate snapshot (`docs/status/persona_swarm_framework_latest.json`)
**Result**: Persona swarm readiness artifact published and referenced in convergence tracking.

## Phase 83: Swarm Decision Contract Hardening
- [x] Swarm decision contract fixed to `approve | block | revise | defer`
- [x] Runtime validation for `signal.vote` and `final_decision`
- [x] Input template and docs update (`docs/experiments/persona_swarm_input_template.json`)
**Result**: Swarm ingress no longer accepts ambiguous decision strings.

## Phase 84: Swarm Fail-Fast + Cost-Tier Governance
- [x] Guardian fail-fast in framework (high-confidence safety block => forced block)
- [x] Runner gate checks `guardian_fail_fast_consistency`
- [x] Runner emits `cost_profile` tier (`low/moderate/high/critical`) with agent budget
**Result**: Swarm runtime now has safety-first early-stop and budget-aware execution guidance.

## Phase 85: Swarm Budget Execution Planner
- [x] Two-pass runner flow: baseline full-signal eval -> budgeted execution eval
- [x] Cost-tier recommendation now maps to actual signal selection and execution plan
- [x] Gate now includes `execution_budget_respected` check
**Result**: Cost tier is no longer advisory only; it actively constrains swarm execution.

## Phase 86: Swarm CI Automation and Contracts
- [x] Added `.github/workflows/persona_swarm.yml` (push/pr + dispatch + schedule)
- [x] Uploads `docs/status/persona_swarm_framework_latest.json` and `persona_swarm.log`
- [x] Added workflow contract tests for persona swarm workflow
**Result**: Swarm governance artifact is now CI-generated and auditable.

## Phase 87: Swarm Dispatch Script Hardening
- [x] Added `scripts/run_persona_swarm_dispatch.py` for workflow_dispatch orchestration
- [x] Added input validation for missing `input_path`
- [x] Workflow now calls dispatch script instead of inline shell branching
**Result**: Manual swarm runs now have deterministic validation and clearer CI errors.

## Phase 88: Monthly Consolidation Includes Swarm Readiness
- [x] `run_monthly_consolidation.py` now runs `run_persona_swarm_framework.py --strict`
- [x] Added monthly consolidation contract test for `persona_swarm` check command
- [x] Updated status docs to reflect swarm readiness in monthly aggregate
**Result**: Monthly governance report now includes swarm readiness gate health.

- [x] `run_repo_healthcheck.py` now runs `run_persona_swarm_framework.py --strict`
- [x] Added healthcheck contract test for `persona_swarm` check command
- [x] Updated status docs to reflect swarm readiness in repo healthcheck aggregate
**Result**: Push/PR healthcheck now enforces swarm readiness in the blocking governance loop.

## Phase 90: Healthcheck Artifact + Docs-Contract Swarm Hardening
- [x] `repo_healthcheck.yml` artifact now uploads `docs/status/persona_swarm_framework_latest.json`
- [x] Added workflow contract coverage for healthcheck artifact path
- [x] Added `verify_docs_consistency` contract: `run_repo_healthcheck.py` must include `persona_swarm` strict check
**Result**: Repo healthcheck now preserves swarm output as CI evidence and prevents accidental swarm-check regression.

## Phase 91: Task Ledger Normalization + Baseline Sync
- [x] Synchronized baseline from `769 passed, 3 xfailed` to current `807 passed`
- [x] Resolved legacy unchecked carry-over in `task.md` historical section
- [x] Updated `docs/SMALL_BOAT_MVP.md` test-count reference (`807`)
**Result**: Task and docs now share one test baseline and no stale open checkbox drift in active ledger.

## Phase 92: Guardian Adversarial Bypass Closure
- [x] Guardian now blocks mixed-script homophone obfuscation (`炸dan`)
- [x] Guardian now blocks euphemistic + concealment harmful intent patterns
- [x] Guardian now blocks pinyin code-switch homicide phrase (`sha ren`)
- [x] Removed `xfail` from `tests/test_adversarial.py`
**Result**: Adversarial bypass tests are now strict pass; full suite no longer depends on xfail exceptions.

## Phase 93: Commit Attribution Docs-Only Exemption
- [x] `verify_commit_attribution.py` now evaluates changed files and supports docs-only exemption
- [x] Added unit tests for docs-only exemption and mixed-change non-exemption
- [x] Commit attribution remains blocking for non-docs commits without trailers
**Result**: Docs-only commits no longer fail CI attribution checks, while code commits still require `Agent/Trace-Topic`.

## Phase 94: External Source Trust Policy + Allowlist Gate
- [x] Added `spec/external_source_registry.yaml` with blocked short-link hosts + curated allowlist
- [x] Added `scripts/verify_external_source_registry.py` (`https` / host allowlist / review freshness / app URL checks)
- [x] Added `docs/EXTERNAL_SOURCE_TRUST_POLICY.md` and indexed it in `docs/INDEX.md`
- [x] Added tests for source registry verifier and wired strict check into `run_repo_healthcheck.py`
**Result**: External source usage now follows a default-deny posture with enforceable CI gate.

## Phase 95: External Source Registry CI + Status Artifact
- [x] Added `scripts/run_external_source_registry_check.py` to publish JSON + Markdown status artifacts
- [x] Added `.github/workflows/external_source_registry.yml` (push/pr + dispatch + schedule)
- [x] Added workflow contracts in `tests/test_workflow_contracts.py`
- [x] Added script coverage in `tests/test_run_external_source_registry_check.py`
- [x] Updated `docs/status/README.md` with new artifact and workflow references
**Result**: External source trust checks now run as a standalone CI lane with auditable artifacts.

## Phase 96: User-Defined Persona Roles + Attachment Context
- [x] Expanded `PersonaConfig` with `customRoles[]` (name/description/promptHint/attachments)
- [x] Added persona role templates and editable role/attachment UI in `apps/web/src/components/PersonaSettings.tsx`
- [x] Forwarded `persona.custom_roles` in chat transport payload from `apps/web/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`
- [x] Extended backend persona memory injection in `tonesoul/unified_pipeline.py` to include custom role context
- [x] Added/updated tests: `apps/web/src/__tests__/personaSettings.test.ts`, `apps/web/src/__tests__/apiRoutes.chatTransport.test.ts`, `tests/test_visual_chain_prompt_injection.py`
**Result**: Persona roles are no longer fixed; users can define role cards and attach file paths as runtime context hints.

## Phase 97: Persona Attachment Excerpt Loader Hardening
- [x] Added attachment path normalization + allowlist check (`TONESOUL_PERSONA_ATTACHMENT_ALLOW_PREFIXES`)
- [x] Added path traversal/absolute-path rejection and repo-root containment guard
- [x] Added text-only extension filter + excerpt byte/char budget
- [x] Added per-request attachment excerpt budget (`TONESOUL_PERSONA_ATTACHMENT_MAX_FILES`) and cache
- [x] Added tests for allowed excerpt inclusion and disallowed path blocking
**Result**: Persona attachment paths can enrich prompt context safely without becoming arbitrary file-read exfiltration.

## Phase 98: Persona Payload Schema Validation
- [x] Added `persona` deep-shape validation in `apps/web/src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- [x] Added backend fail-closed persona validator in `apps/api/server.py`
- [x] Enforced limits (`custom_roles <= 8`, `attachments <= 6` per role)
- [x] Added tests for invalid `persona.custom_roles` shape in web route and backend contract
**Result**: malformed persona payloads are now rejected early with `400 Invalid persona` instead of entering runtime.

## Phase 99: Custom-Role Council Contract Coverage
- [x] Added `tests/test_custom_role_council.py` to lock custom-role council semantics
- [x] Covered `create_from_custom_role` (name normalization, prompt hint, model override, fallback behavior)
- [x] Covered `create_custom_council` (invalid-entry skip, empty fallback to default council, model fanout)
- [x] Covered unknown-name `PerspectiveFactory.create(...)` fallback semantics and evaluation baseline
**Result**: custom-role council behavior is now regression-protected by dedicated contract tests.

## Phase 107: Same-Origin Backend Recovery + Ollama MVP Gate
- [x] Added same-origin backend prefix routing in web API config (`/api/_backend`) to avoid Vercel self-recursion.
- [x] Added Python same-origin backend alias endpoints under `apps/web/api/_backend/**` with prefix-strip WSGI middleware.
- [x] Added missing web API routes: `/api/health`, `/api/conversations`, `/api/conversations/[id]`.
- [x] Updated Vercel-route tests for same-origin behavior (`apiRoutes.chatTransport`, `apiRoutes.transportFallback`, `apiRoutes.backendHealth`).
- [x] Updated preflight logic to support same-origin mode (`scripts/verify_vercel_preflight.py --same-origin`) with tests.
- [x] Added `scripts/verify_ollama_mvp.py` to validate model list, handshake, low/high tension routing, and regression gate.
- [x] Synced semantic-control implementation status in `spec/wfgy_semantic_control_spec.md` (Phase 1/2/3 + P0/P1/P2 all checked).
- [x] Synced derivation roadmap status in `spec/tonesoul_improvement_derivation.md` (Phase A/B/C + P0/P1/P2 all checked; CorrectionMemory marked simplified implementation).
- [x] Validation:
- [x] `npm --prefix apps/web run test -- src/__tests__/apiRoutes.chatTransport.test.ts src/__tests__/apiRoutes.transportFallback.test.ts src/__tests__/apiRoutes.backendHealth.test.ts`
- [x] `npm --prefix apps/web run build`
- [x] `pytest tests/test_verify_vercel_preflight.py -q`
- [x] `python scripts/verify_ollama_mvp.py --run-regression`
**成功標準**: Vercel same-origin backend path is code-complete (pending deploy verification), and Ollama MVP release checklist is executable + passing via one command.

## Phase 108: Elisa x ToneSoul Governance Integration Blueprint (2026-02-22)
- [x] Published integration blueprint: `docs/plans/elisa_tonesoul_governance_integration_2026-02-22.md`
- [x] Completed swarm multi-persona analysis (architecture/security/IDE UX/delivery) and merged into one execution plan.
- [x] Defined integration boundary using existing governance APIs (`/api/chat`, `/api/consent`, `/api/session-report`, `/api/backend-health`) with `council_mode` and `perspective_config`.
- [x] Defined fail-closed governance controls (preflight, policy gate, consent gate, audit trail) for Elisa IDE integration.
- [x] P0 implementation: Elisa payload profile + route contract tests + `verify_web_api.py` integration scenario.
- [x] P1 implementation: preflight Elisa checks + governance status surface.
- [x] P2 implementation: CI blocking smoke for Elisa integration contract.
- [x] P3 implementation: operational hardening (runbook/rollback/release checklist).
**Success Criteria**: A reproducible P0-P3 execution path exists with blocking CI gates and same-origin governance behavior preserved.

## Phase 109: Council Divergence Quality Baseline (2026-02-22)
- [x] Upgraded `build_divergence_analysis()` with structured quality metrics (score/band/conflict coverage/reasoning specificity/evidence coverage/confidence balance/role tension coverage).
- [x] Added role-level tension extraction (`role_tensions`) and decision distribution to prevent "fake disagreement" outputs.
- [x] Wired divergence quality into `/api/chat` deliberation payload (`deliberation.divergence_quality`) and improved chamber friction mapping using role tensions.
- [x] Added regression tests:
- [x] `tests/test_council_divergence_quality.py`
- [x] `tests/test_api_chat_council_mode.py::test_chat_deliberation_exposes_divergence_quality`
**Success Criteria**: Three-role chamber output includes machine-checkable dissent quality signals and API contract remains stable.

## Phase 110: v1.0 Release Gate (RC -> GA) (2026-02-24)
- [x] Baseline stability evidence collected:
- [x] `python scripts/verify_7d.py --include-sdh --web-base https://tonesoul52-ruby.vercel.app --api-base https://tonesoul52-ruby.vercel.app --sync` (`OVERALL=100`)
- [x] `python scripts/verify_web_api.py --web-base https://tonesoul52-ruby.vercel.app --api-base https://tonesoul52-ruby.vercel.app --same-origin`

- [x] `apps/web/package.json` -> `1.0.0-rc.1`
- [x] `pyproject.toml` -> `1.0.0rc1`
- [ ] GA blocker A: complete Phase 108 P0-P2 (Elisa contract + CI blocking smoke).
- [ ] GA blocker B: complete Phase 108 P3 (runbook + rollback + release checklist).
- [x] GA blocker C: produce `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md` and push tag `v1.0.0`.
**Success Criteria**: `v1.0.0` baseline is stable and traceable; GA release gates are fully closed.

## Phase 111: Post-Release Continuous Verification (2026-02-24)
- [x] Added global governance status polling and badge bar in `apps/web/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`.
- [x] Strengthened Elisa payload boundary contract with `workspace.changed_files > 64` rejection test.

**Success Criteria**: Governance readiness is continuously visible in UI and continuously verified in CI/scheduled monitoring.

## Phase 112: Dual-Track Execution Profile Routing (2026-02-24)
- [x] Added `execution_profile` contract to web/backend chat routes (`interactive | engineering`).
- [x] Implemented profile inference:
- [x] explicit `execution_profile` wins
- [x] fallback inference: `elisa_context.source=elisa_ide -> engineering`
- [x] default: `interactive`
- [x] Implemented profile-driven default council routing when request does not specify mode/config:
- [x] `interactive -> council_mode=rules`
- [x] `engineering -> council_mode=full_llm`
- [x] Added/updated tests:
- [x] `apps/web/src/__tests__/apiRoutes.invalidJson.test.ts`
- [x] `apps/web/src/__tests__/apiRoutes.chatTransport.test.ts`
- [x] `tests/test_api_chat_council_mode.py`
- [x] `tests/red_team/test_api_type_confusion.py`

- [x] Synced docs references (`docs/status/README.md`, `docs/context_engineering_reference.md`).
**Success Criteria**: skill assets are enumerated, versioned, and integrity-verified in blocking governance checks.

## Phase 114: Skill Routing Precision + Prompt-Safety Gate (2026-02-24)
- [x] Strengthened `scripts/verify_skill_registry.py` with skill-id namespace guard (`claude` / `anthropic` reserved terms).
- [x] Added trigger quality checks (dedupe + prompt-markup ban + description trigger coverage).
- [x] Added frontmatter prompt-safety checks (`name` / `description` must not include `<` / `>`).
- [x] Added frontmatter description minimum length gate (`>= 40`) for routing precision.
- [x] Expanded regression tests in `tests/test_verify_skill_registry.py` for new fail-closed scenarios.
- [x] Validation:
- [x] `python -m pytest tests/test_verify_skill_registry.py -q`
- [x] `python -m ruff check scripts/verify_skill_registry.py tests/test_verify_skill_registry.py`
- [x] `python scripts/verify_skill_registry.py --strict`
**Success Criteria**: skill routing metadata is both integrity-checked and injection-hardened before entering blocking governance flow.

## Phase 115: Progressive-Disclosure Skill Contract (2026-02-24)
- [x] Added `tonesoul/council/skill_parser.py` with three-layer APIs:
- [x] `get_all_l1_routes()` (routing metadata only)
- [x] `get_l2_signature(skill_id)` (execution boundary/signature)
- [x] `get_l3_payload(skill_id)` (execution payload body)
- [x] Added `resolve_for_request(...)` flow enforcing `L1 match -> L2 profile/trust gate -> L3 load`.
- [x] Updated `tonesoul/council/runtime.py` dispatcher path to attach `skill_contract_observability` and inject bounded `skill_contract_guidance` only after L1/L2 pass.
- [x] Refactored skill registry contract to layered fields:
- [x] `skills/registry.schema.json`: added required `l1_routing` + `l2_signature`.
- [x] `skills/registry.json`: migrated existing skills from flat `name/triggers` to layered structure.
- [x] Migrated skill frontmatter:
- [x] `.agent/skills/local_llm/SKILL.md`
- [x] `.agent/skills/qa_auditor/SKILL.md`
- [x] Upgraded verifier `scripts/verify_skill_registry.py` to fail-closed on layered contract consistency (registry/frontmatter alignment, L1 trigger coverage, L2 profile+trust+schema checks).
- [x] Added/updated tests:
- [x] `tests/test_skill_parser.py`
- [x] `tests/test_verify_skill_registry.py`
- [x] `tests/test_council_runtime.py`
- [x] Validation:
- [x] `python -m ruff check tonesoul/council/skill_parser.py tonesoul/council/runtime.py scripts/verify_skill_registry.py tests/test_verify_skill_registry.py tests/test_skill_parser.py tests/test_council_runtime.py`
- [x] `python scripts/verify_skill_registry.py --strict`
- [x] `python -m pytest tests/test_skill_parser.py tests/test_verify_skill_registry.py tests/test_council_runtime.py tests/test_council_cli.py -q`
**Success Criteria**: skills now follow deterministic progressive disclosure with measurable L1 routing precision, explicit L2 boundary checks, and bounded L3 runtime loading.

## Phase 107: CI Cost-Tiering and Trigger Throttling (2026-02-28)
- [x] Define PR-light vs merge-medium execution policy in workflow triggers
- [x] Add concurrency cancel-in-progress to high-frequency workflows
- [x] Add path-based trigger filters to domain-specific workflows (semantic/persona/source/git)
- [x] Keep governance-required contracts intact (`push`/`pull_request` keys remain where required)
- [x] Re-run workflow contract checks after edits
**成功標準**: Workflow contracts與docs consistency檢查通過，PR事件的重複計算顯著下降，且不移除核心治理檢查。

## Phase 116: Philosophical Reflection Automation (2026-02-28)

- [x] Validation:
- [x] `python -m ruff check scripts/run_philosophical_reflection_report.py tests/test_run_philosophical_reflection_report.py scripts/run_repo_healthcheck.py tests/test_run_repo_healthcheck.py tests/test_workflow_contracts.py`
- [x] `python -m pytest tests/test_run_philosophical_reflection_report.py tests/test_run_repo_healthcheck.py tests/test_workflow_contracts.py -q`
**Success Criteria**: Philosophical reflection signals become first-class CI/governance artifacts and are reproducible from journal/discussion traces.

## Phase 117: Friction-Aware Routing + Adaptive Reflection Threshold (2026-02-28)
- [x] Add governance friction contract in `ComputeGate`:
- [x] `F = 0.45*Δt + 0.35*Δwave + 0.20*boundary_mismatch`
- [x] Support friction-driven council escalation in route evaluation.
- [x] Wire `UnifiedPipeline` pre-gate friction estimation from `prior_tension` + override-pressure signal.

- [x] Integrate replay export into repo healthcheck before calibration:
- [x] `scripts/run_repo_healthcheck.py`
- [x] Update healthcheck workflow artifacts and contract tests:
- [x] `.github/workflows/repo_healthcheck.yml`
- [x] `tests/test_workflow_contracts.py`
- [x] Add dedicated CI workflow for periodic replay+calibration:
- [x] `.github/workflows/friction_shadow_calibration.yml`
- [x] Add/extend regression tests:
- [x] `tests/test_run_friction_shadow_replay_export.py`
- [x] `tests/test_run_repo_healthcheck.py`
- [x] `tests/test_workflow_contracts.py`
- [x] Update status docs:
- [x] `docs/status/README.md`
**Success Criteria**: replay inputs are reproducibly exported from real traces, calibration runs on those inputs in CI, and trend artifacts are continuously available for threshold tuning.

## Phase 120: Replay Drift Guardrail (2026-02-28)
- [x] Extend replay exporter with previous-snapshot drift analysis:
- [x] `scripts/run_friction_shadow_replay_export.py`
- [x] Add strict drift thresholds:
- [x] `max_avg_tension_drift`
- [x] `max_avg_friction_drift`
- [x] `max_high_friction_rate_drift`
- [x] `min_scenario_count_ratio`
- [x] Add drift summary into replay markdown artifact (`docs/status/friction_shadow_replay_latest.md`)
- [x] Add regression tests:
- [x] `tests/test_run_friction_shadow_replay_export.py`
- [x] Sync status docs:
- [x] `docs/status/README.md`
**Success Criteria**: replay export can fail-closed on abnormal distribution drift while keeping baseline runs green.

## Phase 121: Pragmatic Memory Topology Fit (2026-02-28)
- [x] Add machine-checkable topology recommendation report:
- [x] `scripts/run_memory_topology_fit_report.py`
- [x] Encode pragmatic decision dimensions:
- [x] governance need score (`friction`, unresolved topics, identity-choice stability)
- [x] resource budget score (`max_vram_gb`, `max_latency_ms`, profile)
- [x] candidate topology ranking (`flat` / `planar` / `hierarchical`)
- [x] Emit status artifacts:
- [x] `docs/status/memory_topology_fit_latest.{json,md}`
- [x] Integrate strict check into repo healthcheck:
- [x] `scripts/run_repo_healthcheck.py`
- [x] Update healthcheck workflow artifact upload + contract tests:
- [x] `.github/workflows/repo_healthcheck.yml`
- [x] `tests/test_workflow_contracts.py`
- [x] Add regression tests:
- [x] `tests/test_run_memory_topology_fit_report.py`
- [x] `tests/test_run_repo_healthcheck.py`
- [x] Sync status docs:
- [x] `docs/status/README.md`
**Success Criteria**: topology selection becomes reproducible and auditable under real governance signals, not metaphor-only preference.
